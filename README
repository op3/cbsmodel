CBS model
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program allows to calculate predictions of the "Confined beta-Soft 
Rotor model. That is a geometrical nuclear structure model applicable in 
the R_4/2-range from 2.90 to 3.33 for even-even nuclei. It interpolates 
between the the critical point X(5) rnd the rigid rotor limit by means 
of one structure parameter r_beta which ranges from 0 to 1.

A user manual for the usage of the program is provided in 
/doc/manual.pdf
